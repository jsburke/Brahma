general notes for wrie up from john

displacement per time step

using t*(v_i + 0.5*a*t) since it is one less multiply than v_i*t + 0.5 * a * t 
this is easy to vectorize

calculate force once for two bodies, reverse polarity for non-focus, divide by mass accumulate acceleration

Octant structure

Z < 0 octs 0-3
X < 0 even octants
Y < 0 bit signifying 2^1 off (a bit bizarre, but works)

for suboctants, replace zero with mid point
midpoint inclusive to higher value octant
