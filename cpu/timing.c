/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Make the CPU busy, and measure CPS (cycles per second).
|
| Explanation:
| If tests are very fast, they can run so quickly that the SpeedStep control
| (in kernel and/or on-chip) doesn't notice in time, and the first few tests
| might finish while the CPU is still in its sleep state (about 800 MHz,
| judging from my measurements)
|   A simple way to get around this is to run some kind of busy-loop that
| forces the OS and/or CPU to notice it needs to go to full clock speed.
| We print out the results of the computation so the loop won't get optimised
| away.
|
| Copy this code into other programs as desired. It provides three entry
| points:
|
| double ts_sec(ts): converts a timespec into seconds
| timespec ts_diff(ts1, ts2): computes interval between two timespecs
| measure_cps(): Does the busy loop and prints out measured CPS (cycles/sec)
